#Data Structures and Algorithms
This folder contains programs written in Java for my Data Structures and Algorithms class.

##Contents
Dictionary.java is a Java program that takes an input dictionary (text file containing a list of words with definitions), and provides dictionary operations, such as add, remove, and find -- to name a few. It does this through the implementation of a BST.

PathPlanning is a Java program that takes as input a text file containing a "map" with toll roads and a specific budget, and determines the shortest, cheapest path through implementing an edge map and using BFS.
