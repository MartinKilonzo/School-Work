# Team 12 Weather Application
The team 12 Weather Application offers a variety of weather-related functionality through a location-based method of data collection and presentation. The attractive GUI offers short and long term representations of Weather Data collected from the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api). <br>
Our application runs through the main class. To use the application, enter your location, and the weather data will be populated.<br>
When entering your location, you may be as vague as you wish (ie. london, as opposed to London, UK).
