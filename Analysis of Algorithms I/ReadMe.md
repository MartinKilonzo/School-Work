#Analysis of Algorithms I
This folder contains course work written in Java for my Analysis of Algorithms I class.

##Contents
* Assignment 1 contains Java programs:
	 - <b>asn1_a.java</b>, which computes the fibbonacci numbers 1-8;
	 - <b>asn2_b.java</b>, which computes the fibbonacci number of any n using BigInt.java and dynamic programming to maintain a list of prevously calculated values;
	 - <b>asn3_b.java</b>, which computes the fibbonacci number of any n using BigInt.java and matrix multiplication.

* Assignment 2 contains Java program <b>BinaryFind.java</b>, which uses the UnionFind object specified in <b>UnionFind.java</b> to find the connected components in a binary image

* Assignment 3 contains the Java program <b>PrimHeap.java</b>, which uses a min-priority heap as defined in <b>Heap.java</b>, and vertexes as defined in <b>Vertex.java</b>, to create an edge map given an input text file and find the minimum spanning tree using Prim's MST algorithm.
