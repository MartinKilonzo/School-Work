#Software Tools and Syatems Programming
This folder contains all of the course work written in Shell and C for my Software Tools and Systems Programming class.

##Contents
* Assignment 2 contains Bash Shell Script programs:
	- `last_Arg`, which returns the last argument of a command;
	- `numPyramid`, which builds a pyramid of specified width;
	- `odd_Prn`, which prints out all of the odd numbered arguments.
* Assignment 3 contains C programs:
	- `approxE.c`, which returns an approximation of Euler's e, to the nearest x, where x is the least significant digit in the input, where the input is less than 1;
	- `bankBalance.c`, which returns the balance of a loan given a specified principle, interest rate (compounded monthly), monthly payment, and number of payments;
	- `timeAfterTime.c`, which returns the end time after a specified start time, both of the form HHMM.
* Assignment 4 contains C programs:
	- `approxPi.c` and `approxMorePi.c`, which returns an approximation of pi given an input number of iterations using averages and standard deviations respectively; ;
	- `magicSquare.c`, which returns a square of specified width, where the sum of the values in each row, column, and diagonal are the same;
	- `paymentAmount.c`, which returns the minimum number of bills and coins ($20 and under) needed to pay a specified price.
* Assignment 5 contains C programs `complex.c` and `complexTypeDef.c`, which both multiply and divide complex numbers.
