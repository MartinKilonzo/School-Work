#Computer Science Fundamentals II
This folder contains course work written in Java for my Computer Science Fundamentals II class.

##Contents
###Assignments
* Assignment 1 or <i>Calorie Counter</i>, contains a Java program, which returns a calorie count based on an input of specific foods, weights, and calories.

* Assignment 2 or <i>News Feed</i>, contains a Java class `Feed.java`, which takes an input text file with "feed items," and compiles them into an indexable list.

* Assignment 3 or <i>Simple Compiler</i>, contains a Java class `Evaluator.java`, which takes an input of a series of instructions, compiles them and evaluates them.

* Assignment 4 or <i>Lindenmayer Systems</i>, contains a Java program which, given input length and width dimensions and a fractal type, writes a fractal image, images using:
	 - `Main.java`, which acts as the Main, executing the features in the description;
	 - `DrawFractal.java`, which handles image processing;
	 - `MakeFractal.java`, which handles the computation to generate the fractals.

* Assignment 5 or <i>Image Segmentation</i>, contains a Java program which, given specific red, blue, and green thresholds and an input image, isolates the image based on similar pixel clusters using:
	 - `Main2.java`, which acts as the Main, executing the features in the description;
	 - `MyPicture2.java`, which handles image processing;
	 - `QuadTree2.java`, which contains the definition of the Quad Trees used for generating regions;
	 - `Region.java`, which contains the computation behind generateing specific regions.
