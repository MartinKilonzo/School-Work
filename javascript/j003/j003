The task j002 was aimed at seeing how one can work with JSON data in JavaScript.
The task j003 is to extend your work on j002 to make it a bit more user 
friendly.  The extensions are based on feedback from the class.

Stage 0: copy j002/j002.html into j003/j003.html and j002/j002.js into
j003/j003.js (as well as any other files you may be including to get
j002.html to work).

Stage 1: in stage 5 of j002, we have the user indicating whether a
question's answer was right or wrong.  a count of how many right and
wrong answers is then used in stage 7.  the problem comes when someone
marks the question twice (perhaps by accident), either hitting
`correct' twice or hitting `correct' and then hitting `wrong'.  the
first stage is to address the accidental double hit (perhaps bumping
the counter twice) by implementing a rule that once a question is
marked, it can't be remarked.

Stage 2: of course there are times when the question was marked wrong
and that mark needs to be corrected.  this means you would like to
have an `undo' button that allows you to return to the `premarked'
state on the current question, from which you can then mark it
appropriately (hopefully).

Thinking about undo, leads one to wonder about the user history in
general and how a user of this code might want to interact with their
history.

Stage 3: Once you have told the user how many wrong answers they had,
they might want to look at the questions that were getting wrong.  So
it would be nice to have a button that could produce on the html page
such a report.

Stage 4: It would also be nice to have a button that could clear the report.

Stage 5: Although this is more html/css stuff than javascript, it
would be nice if the report was scrollable rather than just dumped on
the page.  Perhaps the link 
   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18953011/how-to-make-a-div-vertically-scrollable
would be helpful in figuring out how to do it.
