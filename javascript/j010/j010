The intent of this task is to build a scanner.  The scanner should read a
file that is a program text and output a file that is a sequence of tokens.
The idea of using file input and output is to make the different stages of
the eventual compiler language independent (i.e., each stage can be implemented
in a different language depending on which language you want to practice).

For security reasons it is difficult to write a useful file from the browser,
so to do this in JavaScript, you will want to look at nodejs, which allows
you to run JavaScript applications outside the browser.  On the department
linux boxes it is in /usr/bin/nodejs.  I haven't ever done this myself as
I have no interest in JavaScript outside of the browser.  However, for 
those interested in exploring this, I would recommend starting with
  http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2496710/writing-files-in-node-js
Remember that spending long (more than 15 minutes) periods of time reading
or watching videos about nodejs is not practice, so unless you are already
familiar with nodejs or have extra time for and interest in nodejs, this
is probably not a good task for you.

As with other tasks, this task is presented as a sequence of stages.  There
are many notations that people use for the lexical structure of a program.
The one I am using here is from the Haskell 98 report
  https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/syntax-iso.html
Although the language I am defining is not Haskell, not having to reinvent 
the definition of things like integers and floats is useful.

Note that when we are processing a token, the longest expression that matches
the token is the one taken, e.g., th12 is a four character variable name and
not two tokens (th and 12).  On the other hand, 12th would be two tokens,
12 and th.  Also, note that no provision is made for reporting errors in
the following.  However, you may find reporting errors helpful in determining
whether or not your code works.

Stage 1: read in a sequence of integers separated by arbitrary amount of
`whitespace' and output a file where each integer is on a separate line,
preceeded by 'i ' (to indicate that it is an integer), but otherwise
no other white space.  The order of the integers in the original file is
the same as their order in the output file (this will hold generally for
all tokens processed by the scanner -- similarly the output file will always
have the format of a type indicator character, a space, and then the actual
token). Looking at the syntax description, formally, I am talking about 
processing:

program	->	{lexeme | whitespace }
lexeme	->	literal
literal	->	integer
whitespace ->	whitestuff {whitestuff}
whitestuff ->	whitechar 
whitechar ->	newline | vertab | space | tab 
newline	->	return linefeed | return | linefeed | formfeed
return	->	a carriage return
linefeed ->	a line feed
vertab	->	a vertical tab
formfeed ->	a form feed
space	->	a space
digit	->	ascDigit 
ascDigit ->	0 | 1 | ... | 9
integer	->	decimal
decimal	->	digit{digit}

For example,
   1 22      90
   33  00001
would generate the file
i 1
i 22
i 90
i 33
i 00001

Stage 2: Lets add in comments, which do not appear in the output file, so the
lexical syntax expands to include
whitestuff	->	whitechar | comment 
comment	->	dashes {any} newline
dashes	->	-- {-}
any	->	graphic | space | tab
graphic	->	small | large | symbol | digit | special | : | " | '
small	->	ascSmall | _
ascSmall	->	a | b | ... | z
large	->	ascLarge 
ascLarge	->	A | B | ... | Z
symbol	->	ascSymbol | _ | : | " | '>
ascSymbol	->	! | # | $ | % | & | * | + | . | / | < | = | > | ? | @
                          | \ | ^ | | | - | ~

Stage 3: Lets add floats the the possibilities.  They will appear in the
output file, like integers, except instead of being preceeded by 'i ', they
will be preceeded by 'f '.  This adds the following to the lexical syntax:

literal	->	integer | float 
float	->	decimal . decimal [exponent]
                | decimal exponent
exponent ->	(e | E) [+ | -] decimal


Stage 4: Lets add in some special symbols.  They will appear in the output 
file prefixed with 's ' to indicate special symbols.  Thuis adds the following
to the lexical syntax:

lexeme	->  literal | special
special	->  ( | ) | , | ; | [ | ] | `| { | } | ascSymbol

Stage 5: The last thing we need to add is variables, which will be prefixed in
the output file by 'v '.

lexeme	->  literal | special | variable
variable -> letterish { letterish | digit }
letterish -> small | large
