#Computer Science Fundamentals I
This folder contains course work written in Java for my Computer Science Fundamentals I class.

##Contents
###Assignments
* Assignment 1 or <i>Turtle Art</i>, contains a Java class 'TurtleArt.java', which uses "Drunken Turtles" to draw an image of a house.

* Assignment 2 or <i>Create Album</i>, contains Java class `PhotoList.java`, which takes an input text file with image locations and descriptors and combines them to generate an "album" of images and their descriptors.

* Assignment 3 or <i>Collage</i>, contains a Java program which, given a set of (small) images and one larger image, will reconstruct the large image as a mosoic of the smaller images using:
	 - `MakeCollage.java`, which acts as the Main, executing the features in the description;
	 - `Picture.java`, which handles image processing;
	 - `TestMethods.java`, which contains test cases for the assignment.

* Assignment 4 or <i>Movie</i>, contains a Java program which creates an animation by morphing an input start image into an end image using:
	 - `MorphingMovie.java`, which acts as the Main, executing the features in the description;
	 - `Picture.java`, which handles image processing;
	 - `TestMorphing.java`, which contains tests for the assignment.
